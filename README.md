# logical_fallacy_taxonomy_d3
One of my undergrad degrees was in Philosophy. So I thought I'd use my skillset to help out the philosophy world. 
This is a d3 Representation of the data from:  http://www.fallacyfiles.org/taxonomy.html

One doesn't need anything fancy to run this, just an internet connection. If you want you can grab the repo and just
open the html page in a browser.

Much debt is owed to the original O.G. of d3:
