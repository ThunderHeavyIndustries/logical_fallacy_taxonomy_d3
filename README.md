# logical_fallacy_taxonomy_d3
One of my undergrad degrees was in Philosophy. So I thought I'd use my skillset to help out the philosophy world. 
This is a d3 Representation of the data from:  http://www.fallacyfiles.org/taxonomy.html

One doesn't need anything fancy to run this, just an internet connection. If you want you can grab the repo and just
open the html page in a browser. If you really don't know what's going on here, just download the zip (the button is to the right) unzip, and click on the html file. No fancy computer knowledge needed.

Much debt is owed to the original O.G. of d3:
